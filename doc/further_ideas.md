1. Currently there's a button when you create a new Pokemon, it doesn't have any affect on anything currently, the idea was to have the ability to create custom Pokemon other that the actual ones, similar to some website I can't recall the name of.
2. In the original database schema there were arenas, currently it's removed from everything. The idea was to have the ability to fight other people with e.g. like some textual interface or something. But that won't happend atleast any time soon.
3. Ability to remove moves from pokemon
4. A cleaner UI for viewing pokemon
